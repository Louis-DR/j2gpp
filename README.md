# j2gpp - Jinja2-based General Purpose Preprocessor

`j2gpp` is a command-line tool for rendering templates using the Jinja2 syntax. It's intended purpose is to serve as a preprocessor for any programming or markup language with a unified syntax and flow accross languages.

## Basic usage

`j2gpp` requires at least one source be provided. The source paths can be relative or absolute, and can use UNIX-style patterns such as wildcards. Template file names must end with the `.j2` extension which will be stripped at render.

For more information about the Jinja2 syntax, see the documentation at [jinja.palletsprojects.com](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/).

For instance, suppose we have a templatized source file `foo.c.j2` :

``` c
#include <stdio.h>

{% set message = "Hello, world!" %}

int main() {
  printf({{message}});
  return 0;
}
```

We can render the template using `j2gpp` :

```
j2gpp ./foo.c.j2
```

The output is written to `foo.c` next to the source template :

``` c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf(Hello, world!);
  return 0;
}
```
